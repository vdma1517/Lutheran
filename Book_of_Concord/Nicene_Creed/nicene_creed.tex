Nicene Creed
I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible 
and invisible. 
  
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only‚Äêbegotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all 
worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one 
substance with the Father, by whom all things were made; who for us men and for our 
salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary 
and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was 
buried. And the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures and ascended into 
heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. And He will come again with glory to judge 
both the living and the dead, whose kingdom will have no end. 
  
And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and 
the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, who spoke by 
the prophets. And I believe in one holy Christian and apostolic Church I acknowledge one 
Baptism for the remission of sins, and I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of 
the world to come. Amen.
